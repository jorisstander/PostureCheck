# PostureCheck

This is the final project for Datascience for Iot.

## Installation

It is recommended to use a virtual environment for your python packages. You also **NEED** Raspbian Buster OS.

1. Install OpenCV by running `pip install opencv-python` check out this [installation guide](https://littlebirdelectronics.com.au/guides/165/set-up-opencv-on-raspberry-pi-4) if you have errors

2. Install mediapipe for Raspberry Pi by running `pip install mediapipe-rpi4`

3. Install Twilio by running `pip install twilio`

## Configuration
Now that we have installed all the packages, we only have to change a few parameters in the code.

There are the 2 scripts in this program:
- main.py ( in this file you can find all the calculations and UI code for this program)
- sms.py ( in this file you can setup your sms service to get notified)

You have to change a few things in sms.py to make this work. These values are commented with #Todo. For more info on this check out [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com).

Note: if you have 2 cameras on your pc, you might need to change a value in main.py. Change the value from 0 to 1, if this is still not working try 2, 3 and so on.

Line 45: `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)`

## Usage

Now that everything is set up, you can run the program. Make sure you have your camera plugged in, and position yourself in front of the camera with a perfect side view. 

Run the script using the command `python posture_detection.py`
The script will begin monitoring the side-view of a person and will calculate the neck and torso inclination. If poor body posture is detected, a text message will be sent to the configured phone number after a certain amount of time.

##Note
Make sure to use the compatible version of the packages with your python version.

##Conclusion
This project uses Mediapipe and OpenCV to detect poor body posture and alert the user via text message. By using a Raspberry Pi and a webcam, the project is able to monitor the side-view of a person and calculate the neck and torso inclination in real-time.
